# Vienna Mosaic: Navigating Social Borders in a Melting Pot

## Abstract

Large cities are hubs of opportunity and interaction, offering access to essential services, attracting diverse populations, 
and promising cultural integration. Yet, beneath this promise lies the complex challenge of urban segregation, 
where socioeconomic disparities and residential preferences can limit meaningful interaction between groups. 
Hosting nearly 40% of Austria's migrant population, Vienna presents a unique combination of high diversity 
and an extensive social housing plan. With its complex demographic landscape, the city is an invaluable case study 
to understand the forces behind urban integration and segregation. In this paper, we use comprehensive administrative 
data to quantify co-residence preferences among migrants and locals. Our findings reveal two major clusters in Vienna 
shaped by wealth disparities, district diversity, and nationality-based homophily. These insights shed light on the 
underlying mechanisms of urban segregation and designing policies for better integration.
