# Quantifying urban socio-economic segregation through co-residence network reconstruction

## Abstract

Urban segregation poses a critical challenge in cities, exacerbating inequalities, social tensions, fears, and polarization. 
It emerges from a complex interplay of socio-economic disparities and residential preferences, disproportionately impacting 
migrant communities. In this paper, using a comprehensive administrative data from Vienna, where nearly 40% of the population 
consists of international migrants, we analyse co-residence preferences between migrants and locals at the neighbourhood level. 
Our findings reveal two major clusters in Vienna shaped by wealth disparities, district diversity, and nationality-based homophily. 
These insights shed light on the underlying mechanisms of urban segregation and designing policies for better integration.
